# CPU benchmark results
## Look at linpack.sh and linpack.c and shortly describe how the benchmark works.

LINPACK is a benchmark for measuring the CPU performance.
Firstly, the linpack.c gets compiled for the benchmark by the shell script linpack.sh.
The program is separated into three different parts which all do extensive floating point arithmetics.
Each of them solves a linear equation system under different conditions like the matrix size or the required precision of the results.
After the compilation linpack.sh executes the C-program and filters the output for the required metric.

## Find out what the LINPACK benchmark measures (try Google). Would you expect paravirtualization to affect the LINPACK benchmark? Why?

The performance is represented by FLOPS (floating point operations per second) metric.
The benchmark only executes calculations on the CPU.
Since it does not involve critical (privileged) instructions, we would not expect the paravirtualization to affect the LINPACK benchmark.

## Look at your LINPACK measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If not, what could be the reason?

Both machines are running on one virtual core.
However, since we do not know what kind of CPU is backing this virtual core the results could still be very different.
In general we would assume that both machines have nearly the same performance since both of them belong to a low-cost instance and both of them have a similar turbo clock frequency.

Although we were not quite sure about the base frequency of the EC2 t2.micro instance, we expected that both machines have a similar performance.
The results show that the GCloud performes in average 272,167.7604 KFLOPS more than the EC2 instance which is about 12.4%.
The average KFLOPS for EC2 is 2,194,698.108 KFLOPS.
The average KFLOPS for GCloud is 2,466,865.868 KFLOPS.

# Memory benchmark results
## Find out how the memsweep benchmark works by looking at the shell script and the C code. Would you expect virtualization to affect the memsweep benchmark? Why?

The memsweep benchmark measures how fast main memory can be accessed and overwritten.
Therefore, a huge heap array with a size of 33,161,216 (~33MB) bytes gets created.
In the next step different locations of the heap array are accessed and overwritten.
We do expect that the paravirtualization slightly effects the measurement compared to a non-virtualized environment, since there is an additional level of indirection introduced.
The paravirtualization only has to validate write requests to ensure isolation (as described in the lecture).
Furthermore, we assume that full virtualization performs worse than paravirtualization, since the later one makes use of command batching for the allocation.
However, since both of the VM's are running in a paravirtualization environment and both machines have sufficient memory capacities to store the 33MB, we do not expect big differences.

## Look at your memsweep measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If not, what could be the reason?

Our measurements show, that the average time for AWS is 5.89 seconds and for GCloud is 6.31 seconds.
GCloud is therefore 7% faster than AWS.
